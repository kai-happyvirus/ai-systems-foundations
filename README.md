# Stack to Transformers — AI Systems Foundations (2026)

A training log to become a globally competitive **AI Systems / ML Engineer** by end of **2026**.  
Focus: **70% Systems (OS/Compilers/Memory/Arch/Distributed)** + **30% ML internals**.

> Rule: **No reference without implementation. No implementation without artifact.**

---

## Goals (End of 2026)
- Explain program execution at **register / stack / heap / virtual memory** level.
- Build small but real components:
  - a tiny **interpreter/compiler** piece
  - **profiling + memory/perf** experiments
  - a small **distributed** ML/system demo (concept + runnable artifact)
- Understand transformer memory costs:
  - explain **attention O(n²)** as **data movement + memory bandwidth** problem
- Produce **meaningful artifacts** (code, logs, diagrams, reports).

---

## Training Principles
Every task must include:

1. **Concept** — the fundamental idea
2. **Reference** — book chapter + docs + blog/article (and optional video)
3. **Implementation** — concrete code or experiment
4. **Artifact** — evidence (code/log/diagram/report)

Every explanation should connect to:
- Memory layout (**stack / heap**)
- Registers intuition
- CPU execution flow
- Virtual memory
- Cache intuition
- Data movement (bus / network)

## Daily Workflow (Mandatory)
Each day (or session) includes:

- ✅ Today’s 2–3 tasks (1–3h each)
- ✅ Concept focus
- ✅ References (specific sections)
- ✅ Implementation steps
- ✅ Artifact to submit
- ✅ 1 Quiz question
- ✅ 1 Reflection question

## Artifact Standards
Artifacts must be **reproducible**:
- Include build/run commands
- Include environment notes if needed (OS, compiler version, Python version)
- Save outputs:
  - `artifacts/logs/*.txt`
  - `artifacts/screenshots/*.png`
  - `artifacts/diagrams/*.md` or `.png`

---

## Getting Started
### Recommended environment
- Linux or WSL2
- Tooling:
  - `gcc` / `clang`
  - `gdb`
  - `perf` (optional)
  - Python 3.10+

### Quick sanity check
```bash
mkdir -p artifacts/{logs,screenshots,diagrams}
mkdir -p weeks/week-01/daily
